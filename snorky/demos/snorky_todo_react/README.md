#Snorky TODO with React.js

A demo project inspired in [TodoMVC](http://www.todomvc.com/) and [IdiomaticReact](https://github.com/netgusto/IdiomaticReact).

# Run

Set up a virtualenv, install the requirements and run `./manage.py runserver`. In parallel, run `./run_snorky_server.py`.

# Further development

The frontend dependencies are located in `frontend/package.json`. Run `npm install` in order to, well, install them. Then, do your changes and run `webpack` (you need to install webpack globally to access the command, otherwise, dive into the `node_modules/webpack/bin/` directory and run `webpack.js`
