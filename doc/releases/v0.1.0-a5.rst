~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`@Alternhuman <https://github.com/Alternhuman>`_ contributed several features and bug fixes:

* Fixed bug `#3 <https://github.com/ntrrgc/snorky/issues/3>`_ that affected Django 1.8+ integration.

* Added a new React.js demo, courtesy of `@Alternhuman <https://github.com/Alternhuman>`_.

On top of that:

* Both ToDo demo applications have been updated to Django 1.9 and Django REST Framework 3.3.

  This also has allowed them to work in Python 3.5, which is incompatible with older Django versions.
